# Operator precedence is taken from https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence.html
# TTreeFormula/TFormula does not explicitly list precedence, so we assume it follows C++ precedence rules.
# The bitwise operators &, |, ~ are not supported, and the bitwise operator ^ is interpreted as exponentiation.
